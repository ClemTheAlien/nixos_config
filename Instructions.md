- For all folders except the `assets` and `limine` folder, copy n paste it into the .config folder and add a . to the beginning of all the folder names
- Move  `./limine/boot.jpg` to `~/.backgrounds` (change the absolute path if u have a user named other than clemmie)
- Finally delete the `assets` & `limine` folder, `README.md` and this file and your done :)

# Welcome to ClemTheAlien's NixOS Dotfiles for Desktop Usage (UNDER CONSTRUCTION DOES NOT WORK CURRENTLY)!
I use home manager so make sure to ```home manager switch --flake .``` ```sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .```
in the .nixos_config directory to update the system :3. 
> NOTE: 
>This config scheme is being readressed due to how clunky it is and me chanhging wm to MangoWC so this repo is NOT a good repo to pull dotfiles from. Sorry....
